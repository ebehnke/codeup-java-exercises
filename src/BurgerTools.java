    //-- SHORT ASSIGNMENT #2 (part 1) --
    //  Create a class of static properties and methods called BurgerTools
    //    Include a string property of mostPopularTopping
    //    Include an int property of averageDaysBeforeExpiration
    //    Include an int property of temperatureWhenCooked
    //    Include a void method called grill() that prints out "Grilling burger"
    //  Create a class called BurgerTester to test assigning and printing property values
    //  and testing methods.
    //  If you have time, add additional properties and methods.
    //
    //  -- SHORT ASSIGNMENT #2 (part 2) --
    //  Refactor your RestaurantDish and RestaurantTest classes...
    //  1) Change your public properties in your RestaurantDish class to private
    //  2) Add getters and setters for these properties (write them manually then erase them and use IntelliJ to do this quickly)
    //  3) Refactor code used in RestaurantTest to set and print these property values...
    //      ...to use your getters and setters
    //  4) Add a constructor method to RestaurantDish that will assign property...
    //    ...values based on arguments passed into the constructor
}
